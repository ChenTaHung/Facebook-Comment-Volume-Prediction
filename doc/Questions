1. Null model validation for multilevel regression model:
  - Does randomness effect in intercept needs to be considered in null model as well? No need!
  
  
  
  
  
2. Scaling variables:
  - Does it make sence for a counting measurement variable to be scaled? 
  - If the data skewed dramatically, is it correct to take log trasnfromation before scaling?
